# Unit-2-Project
Hello Professor Byron! Thanks for taking the time to look at my project. Under the src directory, you can find
all the Java source code that I made. Under the Unit 2 Project Documentation directory, you can find important CSV's and important
Word documents. The CSV's are the products of my plotter, salter, and smoother programs. The Word documents are where you can find
my essays, reports, tutorial, and research project. I hope you find everything you're looking for with ease!
